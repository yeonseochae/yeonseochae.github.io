        <p> The book, “This Equals That”, is a square, hard-cover book that only consists of images. The corners of the book are smooth and round, indicating that the target audience of the book is children. The book describes itself as a circle made up of squares, to turn through the pages, and to consider the pairs. Each page of the book has a photograph and the photographs aligned next to each other are related. Although the photos next to each other are totally different, I was able to make a connection between them as they related through forms, themes, and colors. </p>
        <p>The most prominent Gestalt theory used in this book is continuation. The identical arrangement of photos for each page guides the audience to look and read the book as a whole. The photos lead one thing to another, indicating readers to read the book in a continuation. The clear similarity found between the photographs is another Gestalt principle that adds to form a stronger relationship between the pages. The pages are kept the same as photographs of the same scale are placed on top of a white background. </p>
        <p>This book allows for a rich visual exploration and stimulates creative thinking. Knowing that the two entirely different images relate to each other, I constantly try to make conceptual associations between the images and to find relationships with my own logical and visual sense. Although there weren’t any texts or descriptions of photographs, I was able to tell that the book was speaking to make associations between the aligning images. </p>
